Choosing inputs and structure for neural networks
	- Discussed specific algorithm to choose the best features for mlp neural net, extremely usefull if implementable in rapid miner

Data mining techniques in customer churn prediction
	- Mainly discussed churn prediction
	- Neural net and decision tree are the most frequently used
	- Combining models often yield better results
	- Main data preprocessing methods are feature selection and dimensionality reduction

Applying data mining to telecom churn management
	- Mainly discussed churn prediction
	- Outlining their process of building the model, which can be helpful
	- Found that neural net performed better than decision tree

Improving customer loyalty evaluation methods in the grocery retail industry: a data mining approach
	- Mainly discussed churn prediction
	- Found that adding delivery and discount information improved accuracy

Direct marketing decision support through predictive customer response modeling
	- Discussed segmenting customers for targeted marketing
	- Dataset is purchases from catalog sales and donations, which is somewhat similar to ours
	- While neural net was very effective, decision tree was the best model due to low dimensional dataset
